                <p>
                    Hello, if you made it here you already know my name is Thomas.
                    I am currently enrolled in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. At first I was nervous
                    but as I progress through each module it becomes clearer, to me, that this is where
                    I want to be. Beside my interest in coding, I enjoy playing games with friends, traveling.
                    hiking, and occasionally going on my own adventures.
                    <br />
                    I have had a great time working on the projects you are about to check out. Each
                    one taught me something new, wether it was an issue I encountered, or 
                    a moment of genius, these projects have made me the developer you're looking into.  
                </p>
