                            Hello, if you made it here you already know my name is Thomas.
                            I am currently enrolled in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. At first I was nervous
                            but as I progress through each module it becomes clearer, to me, that this is where
                            I want to be. Beside my interest in coding, I enjoy playing games with friends, traveling.
                            hiking, and occasionally going on my own adventures.
                            <br />
                            I have had a great time working on the projects you are about to check out. Each
                            one taught me something new, wether it was an issue I encountered, or
                            a moment of genius, these projects have made me the developer you're looking into.
                        </p>
